RE: Letter of Recommendation For Prasanna Kumar Reddy Sabbella
To Whom It May Concern,
My name is Bradley Mollman and I am a Project Engineer III with Fedex Supply Chain. I was responsible
for mentoring Prasanna during his internship with us spring of 2022. Prasanna excelled at the challenges
and task that were presented to him. One such task that was required of him was to estimate the
number of trucks it would take to relocate product from one distribution center to another. This task
required Prasanna to analysis the current inventory levels as well as the number of pallets required to
transfer the product. Since the quantity of product that would fit onto a pallet was unknown Prasanna
used data that he collected from another project he was tasked with and developed a pallet
optimization program using Python coding. Using the coding he was able to determine the optimal
number of products that could fit onto a pallet and then estimate the number of trucks and time
required to transfer the product. This became crucial in gaining our external customers confidence in
our ability to timely transfer the product without shutting down the distribution center.
Prasanna was also part of a team that that was responsible for validating the automation equipment
that was recently installed in the new facility. He experienced several challenges during this process in
which he excelled at communicating the issues with not only the internal team but also the external
resources needed to correct the problems that arose during the validation. This allowed the process to
continue and issues to be addressed in a timely manner. His involvement in the process was crucial to its
success. His ability to communicate and develop relationships with his teammates was exemplary.
To conclude, I would like to reiterate my strong recommendation for Prasanna Kumar Reddy Sabbella. If
you have any further questions regarding Prasannaâ€™s ability or this recommendation, please do not
